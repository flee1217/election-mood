I don't need them to suffer to feel great again.Meanwhile they want to ban my people. White colleagues still don't get it. Even after 4 years. Now is the time for every Biden supporter to reach out to one person who voted for Trump.Empathize with them.Tell them you know how they feel (you do, from 2016).Come up with one issue you can agree on.
